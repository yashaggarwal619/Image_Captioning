The Following Repository consists of Image Captioning Project that I made as capstone project in Udacity nanodegree.
I created a Deep Learning Model that  given the image generates appropriate caption for the image.
This project requires an in depth knowledge of both natural language processing and computer vision.
I used Lstm and inception V3 model in combination to solve this project.
